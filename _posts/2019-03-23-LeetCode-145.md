# Description

Given a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values. Here the inorder means [left right root]. LeetCode [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/).

# Recusive Solution

It's quite easy, we jump to the code.

```python
def postorder_rec(Node):
    output = []
    def helper(Node):
        if Node.left:
            helper(Node.left)
        if Node.right:
            helper(Node.right)
        output.append(Node.val)
    helper(Node)
    return output
```

# Iterative Solution

Now we need a stack to save traversed nodes. The nodes in the stack should satisfy the following conditions:
1. The left child of the node has benn traversed.
2. The value of the node has not been saved.

Note that the current node is always the child of the last node in the stack.
step 1: Go through the left child until it donot have left child. And now we have two situation:

step 2:
- have right child
    go to right child and go to step 1
- no right child
    - current node is left child and have sibling
        go to sibling and go to step 1
    - else
        go to father and go to step 2

Finally, when should we stop? Similart to inorder search, if and only if the stack is empty and current node has no right child.

```python
def postorder(Node):
    if not Node:
        return []
    output = []
    Now = Node
    traveled = [Now]
    while True:
        while Now.left:
            Now = Now.left
            traveled.append(Now)
        if Now.right:
            Now = Now.right
            traveled.append(Now)
        else:
            while True:
                try:
                    traveled.pop(-1)
                    output.append(Now.val)
                    father = traveled[-1]
                    if Now == father.left and father.right:
                        Now = father.right
                        traveled.append(Now)
                        break
                    else:
                        Now = father
                except IndexError:
                    return output
```
