# Description

Given a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values. Here the inorder means [left root right]. LeetCode [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/).

# Recursive Solution

It's quite easy, we jump to the code.

```python
def Inorder_rec(root):
    output = []
    def helper(Node):
        if Node.left:
            helper(Node.left)
        output.append(Node.val)
        if Node.right:
            helper(Node.right)

    helper(root)
    print(output)
```

# Iterative Solution

We need a stack to save the traversed nodes. All elements in the stack should satisfy the following condition:
1. The left child (if exist) of the node is traversed.
2. The node value has not been saved to output list.
3. the right child (if exist) of the node is not traversed.
Go through the left child until it donot have left child. Then go back to its parent node by popping from the stack. Save the value of the parent node. Then go to the right child of the parent node. if right child not exist, pop parent node from the stack and do the same things as before until find a parent which has right child.

Then when should we stop? Shall we stop when the satck is empty?
Not exactly true. Remember that when you go back to the root, the stack is empty but you have not checked the right child of the root yet. So the stop condition should be:
1. The stack is empty.
2. The current Node donot have right child.

```python
def Inorder(Node):
    if not Node:
        return []
    output = []
    Now = Node
    traveled = [Now]
    while True:
        while Now.left:
            Now = Now.left
            traveled.append(Now)
        output.append(Now.val)
        traveled.pop(-1)
        if Now.right:
            Now = Now.right
            traveled.append(Now)
        else:
            try:
                while not Now.right:
                    Now = traveled.pop(-1)
                    output.append(Now.val)
                Now = Now.right
                traveled.append(Now)
            except IndexError:
                print(output)
                return
```
