<p>We have the regression model:</p>

\[Y=XÎ²+É›\\
s.t.\ AÎ²=c\]

<p>,where A is comfo
The optimization problem is a given comformable matrix and c is constant. The optimization problem is:</p>

\[min_Î²\ â€–Y-XÎ²â€–^2\\
s.t.\ AÎ²=c\]

<p>This post will only solve estimate the \(Î²\) with dual problems. If you are interested in the geometric solution of it, please read Chapter4 of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/%E5%9B%9E%E5%BD%92%E5%88%86%E6%9E%90-%E6%AD%A6%E8%90%8D%EF%BC%8C%E5%90%B4%E8%B4%A4%E6%AF%85/dp/B01GYIXJ4A">â€œRegression Analysisâ€</a> by Xianyi Wu and Ping Wu.</p>

<h1 id="dual-problem">Dual Problem</h1>

<p>If you are unfamiliar with dual problems, please read the slide from <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZBAyc1hLMxNPVugfWI0M0gAdZqx29lq0/view?usp=sharing">CS524 Wisconsin-Madison</a> first.
The dual problem is</p>

\[max_Î»â€–Y-XÎ²+X(X^TX)^{-1}A^TÎ»â€–^2+2Î»^T(A\hat{Î²}-A(X^TX)^{-1}A^TÎ»-c)\]

<p>,where Î» is the comformable vector and \(\hat{Î²}\) is the MLE estimator of \(Î²\) without any constraints. Now the dual problem can be solve with matrix differentiation.
We solve \(Î»\) with:</p>

\[A\hat{Î²}-c=A(X^TX)^{-1}A^T\label{beta est}\]

<p>Put the solution from \ref{beta est}. We have the solution that</p>

\[\hat{Î²_R}=\hat{Î²}-(X^TX)^{-1}A^T(A(X^TX)^{-1}A^T)^{-1}(A\hat{Î²}-c)\]

<p>This is the same as the solution from geometric method.</p>

<h1 id="note">Note</h1>
<p>I donot check the complementary slackness condition here. You can do it yourself if interested. I omit the calculation in this post. Itâ€™s just simple matrix differentiation. Itâ€™s tedious to write the calculation steps in Markdown and I think itâ€™s better that YOU do it.</p>

<h1 id="music-recommendation">Music Recommendation</h1>
<p>From now on, I will recommend some music at the end of the post. Sometimes I will listen some music if I cannot focus on study. Music will stimulate your brain and make you work efficiently. But listen to music frequently while working will weaken thestimulation. So Listen to music scientificly:-)</p>

<p>Todayâ€™s Music:</p>

<p>â€œåƒ•ãŒæ­»ã®ã†ã¨æ€ã£ãŸã®ã¯â€ â€” ä¸­å³¶ ç¾å˜‰</p>

<p>â€œBoku ga Shinou to Omotta no Waâ€ â€” Mika Nakashima</p>

<p>It can be simply translated as â€œI thought I would have diedâ€. But actually it is not a dark single. Mika said â€œYou may not know the theme unless you listen it to the endâ€ in the press conference. It describes sorrow in daily life. But the world is not hopeless because you still have a little happiness in hand. And here is another song â€œ1-800-273-8255â€ â€” Alessia Cara, Khalid (I also like it Aha). It conveys the similar idea. It encourage me sometimes when Iâ€™m in depression.</p>
