# Flat stacking

This chapter will deal with the skill of creating and building around an open column, or a straight hole in a wall of blocks, in order to make many consecutive tetrises. Generally speaking, stacking contains Upstacking and Downstacking. 

### Upstacking

The term "upstacking" means put every pieces on remainders without holes or gaps (in most cases). The goal is to make your lines open to as many different minos as pissoble so that you won't worry about next piece too much. Now here is the problem: How to define a good or bad surface?

![upstacking1]({{baseurl}}\img\Tetris\upstacking1.png)This surface has no place for the S-, Z-, T-, or O-pieces.

![upstacking2]({{baseurl}}\img\Tetris\upstacking2.png)This surface has no place for the O-, L-, or J-pieces.

A surface that accommodates all pieces is one that contains both bumps and flat areas. It's quite important to capture and remember the characteristics of all minos.

##### Mino O

The O-piece below needs a flat surface.
